# Strategy

## Intentions:

* Separate different algorithms in different classes
* Theis objects are interchangeable

## My example:

In a coffee ecommerce, the order can have a different discount depending on which day of the week it is.
So, the order can choose a different discount strategy depending on the day of the week.
